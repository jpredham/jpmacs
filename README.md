My barely-organized hodge-podge of an emacs configuration
---------------------------------------------------------

Many lines in this config are borrowed from varying sources on the web that I'll
try to cite wherever possible. Many lines are my own. Unfortunately the
structure, due to the way the configs evolved leave something to be desired
(i.e. almost everything is in init.el). I try to make up for in comments what
would otherwise be broken down into modules.
